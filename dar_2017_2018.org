** Goals for Friday set Thursday:
- TODO Multilang: Write Tech Note on librispeech  Tunisian MSA experiment.
I should get results for GALE Arabic run on the Tunisian MSA test set:
Right now I only have tri2b models available:
%WER 36.74 [ 2419 / 6584, 263 ins, 228 del, 1928 sub ] exp/tri2b/decode_Tunisian_MSA_test/wer_14_0.5

- TODO Multilang: Finish librispeech yaounde experiment.
The training and decoding finished last night.
Here is the result:

%WER 45.10 [ 1016 / 2253, 200 ins, 114 del, 702 sub ] exp/multi/yaounde/decode_test/wer_16_0.0

Here are the yaounde results by themselves:
%WER 90.68 [ 2043 / 2253, 80 ins, 728 del, 1235 sub ] exp/tri2b/decode_test/wer_17_1.0
%WER 89.53 [ 2017 / 2253, 139 ins, 439 del, 1439 sub ] exp/tri3b/decode_test.si/wer_17_1.0

%WER 77.76 [ 1752 / 2253, 192 ins, 290 del, 1270 sub ] exp/tri3b/decode_test/wer_17_1.0

These are really bad WERs.

** Goals for Thursday set Wednesday:
- TODO Multilang: Get Minimal example working on Librispeech and Yaounde. Look at file: local/nnet3/combine_egs.sh
There were updates in  the 2 scripts udner steps/nnet3/multilingual
babel_multilang uses them.
I made a  copy of combine_egs.sh under local/nnet3 so that I could use it with modifications that I needed.
combine_egs.sh calls the other script allocate_egs.py under steps/nnet3/multilingual
There were recent updates to allocate_egs.py.
My copy of combine_egs.sh calls the allocate_egs.sh that was updated under steps/nnet3/multilingual.
I should have made a copy of allocate_egs.py to avoid problems.
Anyway, I seem to have solved the problem by just using the combine_egs.sh under steps/nnet3/multilingual instead of my copy under local/nnet3.
I had to remove options and add the --num-archives option.
It is now running on the GPU.

- High Resolution Features.
I have to take a step back because I found that I am not using high resolution features in training and testing the neural network.
I have been extracting the hires features, but I have not been using them. 
I spent the afternoon trying to fix this problem.
The low resolution features are only used to extract alignments.
I have  moved to plp pitch features for the low resolution feature extraction because the babel scripts were doing this.
But now I'm not sure it is worth the trouble.

I am trying to get the kaldi scripts to run.
I am trying to add _hires to the online ivector directory path.
It looks like the nnet3 tdnn script is running.
Later, I have to get the chain model script running.
I have this running for chain models.

I ran multilang again on the following 3 corpora:
1. GALE Arabic
2. Global Phone Arabic
3. Sof Tunisia

Do I have chain model results for these 3 recipes separately?

Here are the results for Softunisia:

We figured out that there were a decent amount of OOVs.
178 words in training that were not in our smaller lexicon.
These probably came from the sarraj data.
407 words in the new Libyan test set that were not in our smaller lexicon.
There were another 66 words that were neither in the bigger qcri dictionary nor our smaller lexicon.
Zac is going to work on the 66 words.

I spent all day on this.
The main problem was cleaning the transcripts in the 3 sub corpora.
1. Jeffrey's word to morphemes list.
2. Tusaalanga' dialogues.
3. Tusaalanga's dialect transcripts.

The transcripts are now at the word level.
If we want to recognize at the morpheme level, we need to analyze  the words into morphemes.

This is really good news!

Yesterday I went to tell Michelle the good news that the MTL method had beaten the chain model method on the gp_arabic dev set. 
I was excited because this was the first time I got the MTL method to give the best results.
Michelle threw a big bucket of ice water over my head by reminding me that critics will say "you just added more data" and you got better results.
So the experiment we need to run is to combine all the data and train a monolingual chain model system. 
I ran the experiment with threee corpora: Globalphone Arabic, Tuniseen and GALE Arabic. 
This morning I started working on reconciling the three corpora so that we can train one chain model on all the data.
Meanwhile,  I ran the MTL trained  models on the softunisia sarraj test set and the results are even more impressive: 13.40 versus 9.34.
Reconciling the three corpora is much easier said than done.
Each corpora uses a different dictionary.
Globalphone Arabic uses a vocalized romanization for the words and an ascii encoded IPA labeling for the phone.
The Globalphone documentation provides a mapping for most but not all the Arabic Characters. 
The vowels are not mapped and it is not clear how to map to tah mar buta alif maqsura, etc.
I do not have access to the mapping between IPA and the ascii encoding used by Globalphone for the phones.
The GALE Arabic system uses a grapheme to grapheme dictionary.
In other words, the model labels are graphemes instead of phones.
The graphemes use the buckwalter encoding. 
Our tuniseen corpus uses utf8 encoded Arabic characters written by Zac. 
The phone set was borrowed from the QCRI dictionary.
I do not know if there is a mapping between our phone set and IPA.
All this points out how difficult it is to reconcile corpora. 
None of this was an obstacle for MTL. 
I guess an experiment we should run is train GALE Arabic chain models and test on the Globalphone  Arabic dev set and softuniseen test set.
Also train a Globalphone arabic monolingual chain model system and test on softuniseen and vice versa.

I only added a couple of lines to the run_multilingual.sh script referring to bnf.
I added a line indicating the bottleneck layer dimension.
I added a line to the neural network config file indicating information about the bottleneck layer.
This line also creates the bottleneck  layer which is the 7th layer.
I also had to indicate that the next layer -- the prefinal affine layer -- should take as input the bottleneck layer instead of layer 6.
Other than that I did not do anyting.

From these results it looks like the problem is overfitting.

This now make the validation fail.

- TODO GP: Get Portuguese working. I should be able to do this since I've done it before. (copy build on a-team workstation?
I worked on gp_french instead.
I found a major problem. I think it is the reason the WER are so low.
I had copied a script to make list from my African Accented French recipe.
I had to be modified to work with gp_french.

I want to know if I can run with all these languages. 
For some of these  languages (French) the baseline tri3b systems are not ready yet.
Results should be ready tomorrow.

- GALE Arabic:
I am working with this corpus because it comes from broadcast news.
I am building the tri3b system on the b-team workstation.
GALE Arabic is a pretty big corpus.
It might take a while to build  the  tri3b system.
I just looked at the alignments analysis file.
There are 319 hours of speech in the GALE Arabic  corpus.

Run multilang on gp_arabic and gale_arabic.
What happens?
Does gp_arabic improve?
Does it beat chain models?

- TODO Multilang: Write a script that runs end to end and uses the above setup commands:
The commands were:
mkdir -p data/gp_japanese data/gp_mandarin
#  link source data/ train directories into building directory:
ln -s ~/gp_japanese/s5/data/train data/gp_japanese
ln -s ~/gp_mandarin/s5/data/train data/gp_mandarin

** Goals for Tuesday set Monday:
- TODO Multilang: Minimal example. Get scripts to do the right thing with the decoding graph.
I'm going to try to list the steps for a minimal exapmle:
- Languages: 
gp_japanese and gp_mandarin

- Locations:
~/gp_japanese/s5 and ~/gp_mandarin/s5

These two directories are the locations where I built the tri3b models.

- multilang Building directory:
~/multilang/s5
This is where we will build new multilang models.

- move to the multilang building directory
cd ~/multilang/s5

- make data directories in building directory:
mkdir -p data/gp_japanese data/gp_mandarin

- link source data/ train directories into building directory:
ln -s ~/gp_japanese/s5/data/train data/gp_japanese
ln -s ~/gp_mandarin/s5/data/train data/gp_mandarin

- make experiment directories under multilang building directory:
mkdir -p exp/gp_japanese exp/gp_mandarin

- link source tri3b alignment directories into multilang building directory:
ln -s ~/gp_japanese/s5/exp/tri3b_ali exp/gp_japanese
ln -s ~/gp_mandarin/s5/exp/tri3b_ali exp/gp_mandarin

- feature extraction:
I wanted to avoid plp features and speed perturbation, but it is happening automatically somehow.


- link dev data:
ln -s ~/gp_mandarin/s5/data/dev data/gp_mandarin/
This and the following commands are  for linking the directory that is needed for decoding

- link lang directory
ln -s ~/gp_mandarin/s5/data/lang_test data/gp_mandarin/

- link tree directory
ln -s ~/gp_mandarin/s5/exp/tri3b/tree  exp/nnet3/multi/gp_mandarin/

* DAR <2017-12-11 Mon>
**  Goals for Monday set Friday:
- DONE Multilang: Decode the target Russian and Spanish with the new hybrid multilang system. 
I am marking this goal as DONE even though it was modified.
I had a misunderstanding about how multilang works and I might still have a misunderstandig. 
I thought the source and target languages were supposed to be different.
My understanding now is that the input and output languages are the same.
The process is meant to improve all(?) the input languages. 
In particular it improves the low resource language.
But the low resource language is one of the input languages.
So I modified my minimal example (and now it is really minimal) to only work with japanese and mandarin.
The idea is that the parameters from these two languages are shared. 
One model set is output (is this right?).
That model can be used to decode both Japanese and mandarin (really?).
Anyway, I am not sure about all the steps in this multilang process. 
I ran the multilang training scripts without any bells and whistles. 
No i-vectors, no pitch and no bottleneck features; I don't even thik I did speed perturbation. 
A neural network was trained. 
Then, I think what happens is that the final layer is adjusted for each language.
So  2 sllightly different models are written, one for Japanese and one for Mandarin?
Then I decoded the Mandaring dev data with the new mandarin model.
I had to do some of this by hand, the scripts did not make sense to me.
Specifically, the scripts wanted to make the decoding graph in the old tri3b directory.
This can't be right.
Anyway, I copied the tree and the lang_test directories from the tri3b model set to the new nnet3/multi model directories.
I ran mkgraph in the new mandarin directory.
Then I decoded with this graph.
The results:
%WER 18.17 [ 3320 / 18274, 373 ins, 697 del, 2250 sub ] exp/nnet3/multi/gp_mandarin/decode_dev/wer_14_0.0

I don't know yet if this is good or not, but at least it is better than the tri3b WER wich was 19.07.
I would have to train the neural network models without the multilang than compare them.
But this seems pretty good since I am not using pitch which was used in the tri3b results.
Anyway, I am happy since I got a minimal example to run.
I'll have to work on the script to make it run without any intervention. 

- TODO Softunisia: Write an end 2 end recipe suitable for submission to the kaldi repository.
I made some progress on this today.
I got the sarraj data from Zac.
I am working on incorporating this into the test set.
I worked a lot on getting the westpoint data incorporated as test data.
I'd rather use data that we can put on openslr.org as test data.

- TODO African French ditto for African French (Yaounde)
- TODO Heroico: Write tn.
- TODO African French: Write outline of paper.
- DONE Softunisia Recipe: Test set. (Zac's transcription of Libian data, Westpoint?)

I did not do this.
Instead I reverted back to the original script.
I set bnf, speed perturb, ivector and ivector to false.
I am trying to get a minimal system to run.
I also restricted the source languages to only the  two languages Japanese and Mandarin.
I made a lot of progress today with this strategy.
In fact, I got passed the training stage and adjustment of priors.
I am trying to get the decoding to run.
I am decoding on Russian for now.

I am including pitch, speed perturbation and bottlenec features all of which makes suffixes get appended to directory names.
The suffixes and affixes are a mess.
I got pretty far with this today, but the directory names is too messed up.

** Goals for Next Week:
- TODO Multilang: Train SAT models for all gp languages.
GP Russian is still a mystery.
The dictionary and the transcriptions seem to come from different places.
I think the problem is with the transcripts.
Heer is what the GP documentation says:
I. Dictionary Generation and Format
The phone-based pronunciation dictionary for Russian contains the pronunciations of all word forms found in the transcription data of the GlobalPhone audio recordings of this language. 
The word forms are given in original Russian Cyrillic script in UTF-8 encoding like it appears in the transcription of the GlobalPhone speech and  text corpus in the directory /trl. 

No, they are not.

The dictionary can also be provided in Romanized script using ASCII encoding as appearing in the directory “/rmn” in the speech & text corpus. 
The conversion between the Roman and the Cyrillic script is given in the section “Romanization” below.

Maybe I can convert from the romanization to utf8?
Yes, I think this is what I need to do.
II. Romanization
The following list describes the original Cyrillic characters used in Russian script, the corresponding UTF-8 code point, and the Romanized form as used in the Romanized transcription files. 
The Romanization and Back-transformation can be achieved by simple one-to-one reversible substitution rules based on regular expressions, e.g. in case of tcl use the following line to convert
“w” into “в”: regsub -all {w} $temp "\u0432" temp

Inconclusive.
I am resetting the number of leaves to 3500 and removing the proportional shrink in experiment 1d.
- TODO GP: Train tri3b models for all languages.

I will probably make this into another TN like the one we wrote for the Yaounde Speech Corpus. 

- TODO multilang: Get minimal example running.
- TODO Multilang: Train all languages up through tri3b_ali.

I finished the 1a run:
1b is running. It uses a smaller (2000 instead of 3500) number of leaves.

SofTunisia: Zac called me. He reminded me that I owed him for stage 17 done with the new dictionary.
I had run it a couple of weeks ago.
I found some problems with the run. 
I fixed the problems and I reran the old stage with the new dictionary.
Hazrat emailed the results to Zac.

Bulgarian: I deleted control m characters. 
Croatian: remove cr. LM is not clear . Possible OOV problem. Dictionary has words with upper case first letter.
Czech: remove cr and down case
Korean: The LM is for hangul characters in UTF8.
Polish: Delete control MM and down case
Russian: Remove cr
Swedish: The 3 components are in different encodings!
The GP dictionary is originally in ASCII.
Thai: Weird line termiators.

I am going to include the text from the test set in the training data for the lm.
My hypothesis is that this will make the WER scores go down.
I propose we make a "canned" demo that only works well on phrases from the CA16 test set.

2.  low-resolution plp pitch features to get alignments to do chain models
3. high resolution mfcc features to train and test the ivector extractor.
4. ? for training testing the chain models.

- TODO Multilang: Run chain model training for all languages (this will help down the line).
I am working on French.
It looks like the problem is with the speed perturbed data.
I think it requires matrices with more rows or columns that for some reason do not exist.
Either I do not use sp data or I figure out how to get the larger matrices.
I can get things to run without the sp data, but I do not think this is what I want.

** Goals for Tuesday:

* DAR <2017-11-03 Fri>
**  Goals for Thursday set Wednesday:
- DONE Workshop. (should take up the whole day)
I thinkthe the workshop was very successful.

* DAR <2017-11-01 Wed>
**  Goals for Wednesday set Tuesday:
- DONE Setup the gp_french and incorporate it into multilang.
I am starting the multilang over again.
I got to the point where the multilang recipe was going to train the ivector extractor.
All the data was pooled.
At this point the utt2spk file failed.
Most of the GP corpora use speaker names like 001.
I have to make them distinct across languages.
So, for example, I'll label them as AR001 and SP001 for Arabic and Spanish respectively.
I also plan on starting small, maybe with 3 languages.
I am starting with Arabic, Bulgarian , Croatian and French. Maybe Turkish too.
Later I'll start over again using the GP LMs, for now I am building the LMS on the training text.

- TODO Study the multilang recipe.
I am reading the Disertation by Ngoc Thang Vu.
It looks like my project this year will consist of replicating some of the work in this disertation and then improving on it with chain models.
The disertation uses DNNS.
My experience with DNNs was a little disappointing.
I think Chain models should do better than the  DNNs. 
- TODO Writing.
The Ngoc Thang Vu disertation is good background for anything we will write about.

** Goals for Thursday:
- TODO Workshop. (should take up the whole day)

* DAR <2017-10-31 Tue>
** Goals for Tuesday set Monday:
- TODO Multilang: Investigate recipe.
My current understanding is that the multilang recipe is going to make a nnet3 model on all the data I feed it, which right now comes from 8 languages.
Then the target language data is used to train/retrain the last layer of the neural net.

- TODO Writing.
Steve and I discussed a mind map for the paper.
I think we can write about the chain model versus tri3b results:
Look at the first 3 columns of the table below.
tri3b on gp: 35.85
Chain model on GP: 51.27
Add 3 hours of Gabon Read: 
tri3b with 3h of babon read: 19.84

** Goals for Wednesday set Tuesday:
- TODO Objectives:

1. TECHNICAL COMPETENCE
a. Acoustic Models for Low Resource Languages
I. Problem
ASR components like acousti models are not available for key low resource languages and accented versions of major languages.
II. Research Question
Can small and large resources available from many languages be leveraged to build acoustic models for a language for which we have very few resources?
III. Proposed Method 
I will choose a target language say Korean for which we actually have some resources so that we can evaluate results. 
I will use the kaldi multilang recipe to build acoustic models for the target "low" resource language Korean given resources from many other source languages. 
I will obtain the source language resources from the GlobalPhone corpus and government owned corpora that are available to us (see below).
b. Corpus Curation
I. Problem:
In my previous job at West Point, I was part of a team that developed speech corpora for the following languages: 
A. Arabic (West Point LDC2002S02)
B. Arabic (Tunisia)
C. French (collected in Yaounde Cameroon)
D. Croatian (LDC2005S28)
E. German
F. Korean (LDC2006S36)
G. Portuguese (Brazilian LDC2008s04)
H. Russian (West Point LDC2003S05)
I. Russian (SOF Peter)
J. Spanish (Heroico LDC2006S37)

Of these 10 corpora, 6 were published in the Linguistic Data Consortium. 
The remaining 4 corpora for Arabic, French, German and Russian are available to our team and have yet to be published. 
Unless the corpora are published, results obtained from training ASR systems with them are not reproduceable.

ii. Proposed Method: 
I have 3 related goals this year concerning these 4 remaining corpora.
First, I want to prepare these corpora for use as source data in the multilang project mentioned above. 
Second, I want to publish these corpora in the openslrm.org repository.
Third, In addition to the multilang project, I want to write Kaldi recipes for each corpus. 

Publishing these corpora is an important goal. 
It is not hard to imagine these corpora disappearing after our generation retires. 

Preparing the data and writing the recipes will entail producing a lexicon that I also would like to publlish on openslr.org.

** Goals for Thursday:
- TODO Objectives:
- TODO SOFTunisia: Finish training with stage 16 speakers and get rough draft to ZAC.
- TODO African French: Build system without ARTI corpus.
- TODO Heroico: Incorporate subs trained lm into system.

- TODO Heroico: Get results for gplm 
The chain model WER results for the gplm decoding are not good.
I'm not sure what is wrong.

- TODO Heeroico: Build bigger lm and test.
I asked Justin to download the subs Spanishcorpus.
I'll try making an lm with subs.

- DONE SOFTunisia: Finish subs lm

- DONE SOFTunisia: Build cd gmm hmm system and chain models
I finished the cd gmm hmm and I sent Zac the rough draft for the simple decoding.
I did not do chain models.
- DONE: Get rough draft hypotheses for stage 16?
I sent Zac all the hypothesis transcripts for CTELLTWO.
I asked him to work on the first 4 speakers.
- TODO SOFTunisia: Compare WER scores for old and new lexicons(Zac will do this)

** Goals for Wednesday:
- TODO Objectives:
- TODO Heroico: Finish run on clsp cluster and contact Yenda
- TODO SOFTunisia: Get feed back from Zac and send him the hypotheses from the gplm decoding.
- TODO Yaounde: Why are WERs so bad?
- TODO Heroico: Build lm with subs? 
* DAR <2017-10-02 Mon>
** Goals for Next Week:
- TODO Objectives:
- TODO African French: build systems on progressively larger amounts of data.
- TODO Multilang: minimal example.
- TODO Yaounde: Writel recipe to kaldi standards (organize data).
- TODO Yaounde: Figure out why WER scores are so bad: test on training data
- TODO SOFTunisia: Rebuild system with Zac's new lexicon.
I focused on this today.
I am trying to make a clean fresh start.
I am building the new system in the softunisia/s5 directory.
I wrote new scripts to process the answers and recordings training data without copying files.
These scripts are very similar to the ones I wrote for heroico. 
Zac wants me to start from stage 15 and redo stage 16.
This is a good idea since he can compare the new lexicon with the old one. 
As I am getting ready to leave, I am building an LM with the subs corpus.

- Heroico: 
I added commands to my run.sh script to use the gp lm in testing.
I get the following WER results:
