\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec-2}

For the experiments described here, we used the \gls{ann} as a framework for acoustic modeling in \gls{asr}. 
Recently, large \gls{asr} systems have been trained on tens of thousands of hours of speech data \cite{Heigold13multilingualacoustic}. 
\glspl{ann} have performed well when these amounts of data are available. 
We assumed we are under conditions of severe training data sparcity
% paucity
in the \gls{tl}.
We also assumed that we have access to a large corpus of speech in another language. 
We refer to this other language as the \gls{bl}.

\gls{mtl}\cite{Caruana93multitasklearning:} is a framework that enables the advantages of \gls{dl} to be applied in the situation where
% we have access to
there exists
% large amounts of data
plentiful resources
in the \gls{bl} and scarce resources in the \gls{tl}.  

Our research question was formulated as follows.
Can a \gls{ann} \gls{am} trained with \gls{mtl} on data  from  two different languages improve performance of an  \gls{asr} system for a  \gls{tl} that is a \gls{lrl}?
