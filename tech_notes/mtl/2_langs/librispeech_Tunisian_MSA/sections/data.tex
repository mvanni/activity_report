\section{DATA}
\label{sec-3}

We ran an experiment to test the \gls{mtl} method on two specific publically available corpora: the large Librispeech English corpus and a small corpus of Tunisian Accented \gls{msa}. 


\subsection{Librispeech}
\label{sec-3-1}

LibriSpeech is a corpus of read speech, based on LibriVox's public domain audio books.
The corpus is available at:

\url{http://www.openslr.org/resources/12}.

We used the cleaned training fold of 960 hours of speech. 

\subsection{Tunisian \gls{msa}:}
\label{sec-3-2}

This is a corpus of ten hours of \gls{msa}
% as spoken by 120 male and female Tunisians
collected
in 2003
from a sample of 120 mixed male and female informants. 
The informants provided recitations and answers to questions.
