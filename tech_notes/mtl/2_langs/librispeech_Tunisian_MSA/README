The arlticle document class has been created to format LaTeX documents
according to the ARL tech report standard.  It was written by Steven
Segletes, based on an earlier arltr class file obtained from Brian
Krzewinski by way of Stephen Schraml.

To get started using this class, it is recommended that you use the
"arlstencil" file that was constructed as a template for use with the
arlticle document class.
