\section{DATA}
\label{sec-3}

We ran an experiment to test the \gls{MTL} method on two specific publically available corpora: the large Librispeech English corpus and a small corpus of Mexican accented Spanish. 



\subsection{Librispeech}
\label{sec-3-1}
LibriSpeech is a corpus of read speech, based on LibriVox's public domain audio books.
The corpus is available at:

We used the cleaned training fold of 960 hours of speech. 

\subsection{Heroico}
\label{sec-hero}

Heroico is a corpus of ten hours of spoken Spanish.
it contains data from a total of 120 speakers.
102 of those speakers were Mexicans.
A smaller set of 8 native and 10 nonnative speakers make up the test set. 
The informants provided recitations and answers to questions.
